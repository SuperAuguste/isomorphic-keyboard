# Isomorphic Keyboard

A random pang of inspiration struck me so I decided to just make this isomorphic keyboard for 12edo.

## Layout

From any key:
- Up and left: Minor Third (3 edosteps)
- Up and right: Fifth (7 edosteps)
- To the right: Major Third (4 edosteps)

There's definitely some fancy math that exists (lattices I believe) for laying out optimal
isomorphic keyboards, but I pulled a JPEG of a QWERTY keyboard into GIMP and annotated it for
a couple minutes until I found a layout that covered all 12 edosteps repeatedly with notes next
to each other that are consonant.
